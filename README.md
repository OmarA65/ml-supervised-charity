# ml-supervised-charity

## About the project
Machine Learning for finding potential donors for charity using supervised techniques such as Random Forests and Naive Bayes. The aim of this project is to classify whether an invidual earns more 50,000 or less than 50,000 in order to determine whether the individual is willing to donate, based on certain features.

## Dataset
The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf).

## Summary of findings
The findings are provided within the notebook in detail along with charts to represent said findings.
